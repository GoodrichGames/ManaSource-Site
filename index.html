                                focuses around
                                player vs player arena-style combat to battle for control of Mana Wells scattered

                                Mana Source features a unique balancing system never seen before in a physical card game!
                                Players are encouraged to sign up for push notifications on the website to receive live notifications
                                of balance changes.  The full list of latest card versions are available on the
                                <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.  Each set will include a set of stickers used
                                to change card values for balancing purposes.
                            </p>

                            <h4>How to Play</h4>
                            <p>
                                Each round, a player selects 1 card to play and plays it facedown in the center of the
                                play area. Players simultaneously reveal the cards, pay the card cost, resolve the
                                action,
                                and resolve other effects. Cards enter one of 9 “timer” zones
                                to indicate that it cannot be cast until removed from the timer zones. Cards move to
                                the lower numeric recharge step zone at the end of each round. If a card is in the
                                lowest timer zone, the next round it moves back to the player’s hand.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Explore the Classes</h4>
                            <p>
                                Wizard (Elemancer) - Command over the elements: Fire, Water (Ice), Earth, Electricity,
                                Air. This group of people tends to live as traveling merchants to other nations.
                                They are long sought after for their terraforming, forge supporting, water ducts,
                                farming.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Warden (Ecomancer) - Command over living nature: Plants, Animals, tools/weapons made
                                from plants, nature spirits. This group of people tends to live in “wooded” communities
                                for obvious reasons. Many of the villages are constructed from natural materials on
                                the ground floor of the forest, then raised up to just below canopy level via growth
                                into the tree or controlled vines. The canopy is woven into tightly packed foliage
                                that has the appearance of hills and rolling pastures rather than trees. These merge
                                into the surrounding landscape, creating vast, dark ground areas that many choose to
                                ignore. Some say the dead have washed down below year after year. Other villages live
                                in vast networks of caves in mountains and steep ridges, villages extending far up into
                                the rock. They tend to be curious in nature and explorers. Tend to be bonded with
                                animals
                                though they do hunt and eat animals too wild even for them to tame. They provide a great
                                deal of natural medicine, toxins, herding, and food for other nations.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Illusionist (Illusimancer) - Command over illusions, perception, and the mind. Generally
                                thought of as vagrants, criminals, and untrustworthy by nature. Various involvement in
                                criminal activity such as forgery, disguises, “gambling”, suggestion, and interrogation.
                                As such their numbers have dwindled over the years due to prosecution and persecution.
                                Illusionists that do have claim to legitimacy often live as performers, soothers,
                                councilors,
                                and criminologists, though many are builders - they value reality. They maintain a
                                facade
                                of huge illusionary parapets, grand towers, and other resources to project power as a
                                nation but in reality exists as a few small legitimate living families.
                            </p>

                                Knight (Vigormancer) - Command over physical aptitude: strength, speed, endurance.
                                An honorable community with a bloody history. Upon a time the majority of the humans in
                                the world were vigormancers,
                                priding themselves on physical prowess and glory in battle above all else. Various wars
                                were fought over land control, power, and a fear of more outward magic users. Many
                                choose
                                to ignore their families’ exploits in the last great war, tracing their lineage only
                                back to a
                                time when the Knight’s code was established. Some now say that the great war never
                                happened at all,
                                that is it a myth made up by opposing nations to vilify the Knight nation-states. They
                                rarely
                                directly channel mana in the same way that the other magic schools do, preferring the
                                strength
                                found in adrenaline coursing through their veins. It is not well known that Vigomancers
                                (more commonly called, Knights) still draw and convert mana in this process but due to
                                enhancements in their physical systems, consume it at a more efficient rate.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>
                                Doctor (Biomancer) - Command over life: life force, life <-> mana conversion,
                                automatons, sickness.
                                An all but lost art. Once the doctors and medics of the vigormancer empires, many were
                                forced into creating human mana sources, plagues, and combat automatons that directly
                                opposed their underlying belief in the sanctity of life. “What is made should not be
                                unmade.” Many chose to take on the appearance of death itself instead of serve those
                                who would subvert that. Their automatons roam the land searching for ways to fulfill
                                their defined purpose, unbeholden to any master but the one who created them. They have
                                dwindled much in number and largely become myth, only the automatons evidence that they
                                ever existed at all. Those who have taken on death await an awakening.

                                Solarmancy - Command over light, courage, shields. Teachers, scholars, and leadership.
                                Their race is generally long dead though many of their gems are used by vigormancer
                                leadership.
