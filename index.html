                                they have organized into Corporations and taken up Artifacting, a means of generating elements
                                from mana in a mechanically repeatable fashion.  Overall, they live the most freely due to a
                                high degree of self-sufficiency.  Outsiders are not allowed into their community, out of
                                fear of what has happened to the other nations.

                                Wardens prefer wooded communities for obvious reasons.  Traditionally many of the cities
                                were constructed from natural materials on the ground floor of the forest, then raised up
                                to just below canopy level via growth into the tree and controlled vines.  As Knights grew
                                aggressive and learned that Warden lodging relied on flammable timber, this became
                                indefensible.  Some claim at least one of these villages still exists, though its manner
                                of concealment is not disclosed.  Others were driven underground to vast networks of caves
                                in mountains and steep ridges, villages extending far up into the rock.  They provide a
                                great deal of natural medicine, toxins, and food for non-Knight nations.

                                Illusionists are widely thought of as vagrants, criminals, and untrustworthy by nature.
                                To some extent this is true, as many have engaged in a variety of criminal activity such
                                as forgery, suggestion, and “gambling”.  As such, their numbers have dwindled over the
                                years due to prosecution and persecution.  Illusionists that prefer honest work often
                                live as performers, soothers, councilors, and criminologists.  Many others are builders -
                                they value reality.  There is one last known Illusionist city, though somehow outsiders
                                never manage to visit.

                                Knights live under honor or the law, and almost unilaterally come from a brutal history.
                                Various wars were fought over land control, power, and a fear of more outward magic users.
                                At this time, the majority of the humans in the world are Knights.  They rarely directly channel
                                mana in the same way that the other nations do, preferring the strength found in
                                adrenaline coursing through their veins.  It is not well known that Knights still draw
                                and convert mana in this process.  Due to physical training and method, they use it at
                                a more efficient rate than other Formers.

                                forced into creating human mana sources, plagues, and combat automatons that directly
                                opposed their underlying belief in the sanctity of life.  Many chose to take on the
                                appearance of death itself instead of serving those who would subvert that.  Their
                                automatons still roam the land searching for ways to fulfill their defined purpose,
                                unbeholden to any master but the one who created them.  They have dwindled much in number,
                                and until recently, only the automatons evidence that they ever existed at all.  This
                                all changed when a young Warden found their underground vault...
